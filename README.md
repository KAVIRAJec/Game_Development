## Game Development 

   Hello everyone, I have learn the basics of game development and I have created a demo game application.For development of game, i used unityhub software because it is easy to learn and implement.For the coding part, I have C#.I have also used the 3D presets available from google the object and obstracles.I have developed a basic game with moving car and obstracles and with a bit of C# program.The difficulties I faced with unityhub are the software windows are hard to maintain and the software occupied huge storage size.I have also learn about VR and AR fechnology.I also practically used the VR tool.
